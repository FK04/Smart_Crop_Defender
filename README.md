# Smart Crop Defender
An Effective Solution For Crops and Farmers

# 🌱 Smart Crop Defender

Smart Crop Defender is a machine learning–based application designed to detect plant diseases from leaf images.  
The project aims to support early disease identification to help farmers and researchers take timely action.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Dataset images are preprocessed and labeled  <br>
2. A CNN model is trained using Keras  <br>
3. The trained model is saved for reuse  <br>
4. New plant images are tested for disease prediction  <br>
